# E-Commerce Project

Given a dataset of items, you must create an e-commerce app that will showcase all of the provided items in an _elegant_ way.

TODO: more details.

## Goal

## Data details

There are 349 items in the `_data/items.json` file. The data is mostly clean, but there could be some irregularities, i.e. empty values, values that we really don't need. _This is common in large databases, and something that we have to deal with._

### Item Object

```js
  {
    "name": "Barska GB12166 Fitness Watch with Heart Rate Monitor",
